OneCart is a full-stack e-commerce web application developed using the MERN stack, aimed at replicating real-world online shopping platforms with a strong focus on clean architecture, secure authentication, and smooth user experience. The project demonstrates how a modern web application handles end-to-end functionality, from user interaction on the frontend to secure data processing on the backend.

The application includes core e-commerce features such as user registration and login, Google OAuth authentication, product browsing, search functionality, and cart management. Authentication is implemented using JWT and cookie-based sessions, ensuring secure access to protected routes and persistent user sessions across page reloads.

OneCart also integrates an AI-based voice feature that provides text-to-speech responses, enhancing accessibility and improving overall user interaction. This feature adds an innovative layer to the application and showcases the practical use of AI capabilities within a web-based system.

The project is structured with a clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and database layers, following industry-standard development practices. With a scalable codebase, modular design, and real-world features, OneCart serves as a strong portfolio project that reflects practical full-stack development skills.
